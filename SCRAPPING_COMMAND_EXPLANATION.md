# Scrapping Command Explanation

## What is Scrapping?

**Scrapping** is a command that helps you refine and polish your rough ideas or text into comprehensive, well-structured answers. It's like having an editor that takes your initial thoughts and turns them into professional, detailed responses.

## How It Works

### 1. **Basic Usage (No Notes)**
When you type `scrapping` or `scraping` without any additional text:
- The system analyzes your current question and conversation context
- It generates a refined version based on your business context
- It may conduct web research to add current data and insights
- Returns a polished, comprehensive answer you can review and modify

### 2. **With Notes (Recommended)**
When you type `scrapping: [your rough notes/ideas]`:
- The system takes YOUR specific notes/ideas
- Refines them into professional, structured content
- Expands on your ideas with industry-specific insights
- Adds relevant details based on your business context
- Conducts web research if needed to add current data
- Returns a polished version that keeps YOUR core ideas but makes them more comprehensive

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** You're asked about your marketing strategy, and you have rough notes like:
```
"social media, maybe facebook ads, target small businesses"
```

**Command:** `scrapping: social media, maybe facebook ads, target small businesses`

**Result:** The system will:
1. Take your rough notes
2. Refine them into a comprehensive marketing strategy
3. Add industry-specific details
4. Include research-backed insights (e.g., current Facebook ad costs, best practices)
5. Structure it professionally with sections and bullet points
6. Return a polished answer you can accept, modify, or use as a starting point
